## Wildcards with Adetailer Support (Automatic1111 / Forge)

#### Supports:
* ***All Prompts***: Positive \ Negative \ HR Postive \ HR Negative \ Adetailer Positive \ Adetailer Negative
* ***Nested Wildcards*** inside of wildcard text files. (ie. hair.txt line 1: `__20_hairstyle__ __21_haircolor__ hair` makes for a cleaner looking prompt where you only need one wildcard. `__0_hair__`. Be careful when nesting a wildcard inside of itself.)

#### Features
* ***Tiered Wildcards*** that share the same random generation based on the seed. (ie. `__0_wildcard__` up to `__99_wildcard__`)
* ***Iterative wildcards*** that go through wildcard text files line by line in a batch. (ie. `__$_wildcard__`)
* ***Locking wildcards*** to specific lines. (ie. `__0_wildcard_9__`/`__$_wildcard_9__`/`__wildcard_9__` in which in all cases the ninth line fromt he wildcard will be chosen.)
* Depreciated vanilla use. (ie. `__wildcard__` completely random, remaking the same seed will never be the same, haha.)
#### Menu
* Locking random seed generation to a specific seed.
* Changing inner and outer separators.

#### Tiered Wildcards: `__0_wildcard__` up to `__99_wildcard__`
* The number represents a linked random seed generation. So `__0_wildcard__` will output the same result in any prompt. As long as the wildcards have the same number of lines, can link different wildcards with each other. (ie. `__5_one__` and `__5_two__` where one.txt and two.txt both have 50 lines of text will always pick the same line result.

#### Incompatibility:
- Do not use `_`character in wildcard txt file names. (or whichever INNER separator you input in the menu, the inner separator will conflict with any instances of it in wildcard text file names.)
- Do not use `__` anywhere else in the prompt. (or whichever OUTER separator you input in the menu, the outer separator will conflict with any instances of it in the prompt text.)
- Does not work properly with Batch Size. Use Batch Count instead when making batches.
